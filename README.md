## Dion / Dondizzzzzle

This profile is hosting an ongoing digital history project on one of two subjects: the *'pataphysics* movement in France that partially coincided with Dadaism during WWII, or the connection between history and fiction particularly attested in science fiction, especially around the late 1800s and 1900s.

As I'm writing this README, I am actually more inclined to study the latter one for historiographical reasons, though the former is still good as a general piece of history which could happen to be digitalised.
